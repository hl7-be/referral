# The pages property corresponds to IG.definition.page. SUSHI can
# auto-generate the page list, but if the author includes pages in
# this file, it is assumed that the author will fully manage the
# pages section and SUSHI will not generate any page entries.
# The page file name is used as the key. If title is not provided,
# then the title will be generated from the file name.  If a
# generation value is not provided, it will be inferred from the
# file name extension.  Any subproperties that are valid filenames
# with supported extensions (e.g., .md/.xml) will be treated as
# sub-pages.

# The ImplementationGuide resource defines several other properties
# not represented above. These properties can be used as-is and
# should follow the format defined in ImplementationGuide:
# * meta
# * implicitRules
# * language
# * text
# * contained
# * extension
# * modifierExtension
# * experimental
# * useContext
# * copyright
# * packageId

# The menu property will be used to generate the input/menu.xml file.
# The menu is represented as a simple structure where the YAML key
# is the menu item name and the value is the URL. The IG publisher
# currently only supports one level deep on sub-menus.
# To provide a custom menu.xml file, do not include this property and
# include a `menu.xml` file in input/includes.

    description: |
      On 03/10/2022, the patient consults his doctor (prescriber) and admits he has difficulty following his medication-treatment.
      The prescriber detects no valid reason (“medical reason” via CareSet ProbCode) for refundable medication preparation (appendix 81) so he tells his patient that the asked help for his medication preparation will not be refundable. The patient still wants help even if it is not refundable. The prescriber completes the digital prescription for “medication prefill preparation – not refundable”. The digital prescription cannot be completed without the signature of the prescriber. As all “required signatures conditions” are fulfilled, the PrescriptionStatus is automatically set from Draft to Pending/Active. (In our Case “Active”).
      The prescriber also prepares the medication scheme so the nurse that will be assigned to this prescription has all the necessary information to prepare the medication and fill the pillbox of the patient. He gives the medication scheme to the patient so that he can give it to his nurse.
      The patient assigns a nurse to his prescription via the digital application. The assigned nurse consults the digital prescription via the digital application.
      On 06/10/2022, the nurse goes to the patient who gives her his medication scheme. On a weekly basis, the nurse goes to the patient to prepare his medication and fill his pillbox according to the medication scheme received. This service is not refundable, and the nurse charges the patient himself.
